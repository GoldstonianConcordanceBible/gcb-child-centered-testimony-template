# Privacy & Redaction

## Default rule
Assume anything in a GitHub repo could become public. Prefer **private storage** for raw files and store only:
- indexes
- references
- redacted summaries
- filenames that do not reveal sensitive info

## Never publish (especially about a minor)
- full name, DOB, address, school, classroom, teacher names
- medical details
- schedules that reveal predictable location patterns
- passport numbers, SSNs, IDs, account numbers

## Redaction approach
- Replace child name with: **[CHILD]**
- Replace addresses with: **[CITY/STATE]**
- Replace schools with: **[SCHOOL]**
- Replace phone/email with: **[REDACTED CONTACT]**
