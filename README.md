# GCB Child-Centered Testimony Template (Mirror → Water → Fire)

This repository is a **template for parents** to organize custody/parenting-time documentation in a way that is:
- **child-centered**
- **neutral in tone**
- **organized, verifiable, and reviewable**
- **privacy-conscious**
- compatible with attorney review and court filing workflows

## Not legal advice
This template is **not legal advice**. Laws and procedures vary by jurisdiction. Use this as an **organization system** and review with a qualified attorney.

## The Method (Mirror → Water → Fire)
- **Mirror (Facts):** What can be verified? Dates, messages, orders, receipts, logs.
- **Water (Patterns):** What repeats over time? What’s consistent across sources?
- **Fire (Remedies):** What child-centered solutions should be requested?
