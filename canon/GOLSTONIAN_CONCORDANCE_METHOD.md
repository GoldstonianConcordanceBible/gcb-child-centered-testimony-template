# Goldstonian Concordance Method (Mirror → Water → Fire)

This method exists to make a record:
- easier to review
- harder to misinterpret
- more respectful
- more focused on the child

## Mirror (Facts)
Only include:
- dates/times
- direct quotes (when lawful and appropriate)
- screenshots/photos (stored privately; referenced by exhibit ID)
- court orders (cite date/file stamp)
- receipts/logs/metadata

**Mirror rule:** Every key claim gets an exhibit anchor.

## Water (Patterns)
After Mirror is built:
- build chronology
- cluster repeated issues
- cross-check contradictions
- identify missing records

**Water rule:** Patterns require multiple Mirror items.

## Fire (Remedies)
Convert verified patterns into:
- child-centered requests
- clear schedules
- communication protocols
- make-up time procedures
- compliance-friendly solutions

**Fire rule:** Requests should emphasize stability, predictability, access, and reduced conflict.
