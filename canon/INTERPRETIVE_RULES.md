# Interpretive Rules (Credibility Rules)

## 1) Separate Fact from Interpretation
- Fact: “The message was sent at 6:12pm.”
- Interpretation: “This shows unwillingness to cooperate.” (Only allowed if supported as a pattern)

## 2) Use Exhibit Anchors
Every meaningful claim links to:
- EXH-### (primary)
- plus a log entry date/time

## 3) Admit uncertainty
If you don’t know, write:
- “Unknown / not confirmed.”
- “No record available in [system].”
- “Awaiting confirmation.”

## 4) One event = one entry
Don’t combine multiple incidents into one paragraph.

## 5) Don’t editorialize
Let the record speak; keep conclusions brief and remedy-focused.
