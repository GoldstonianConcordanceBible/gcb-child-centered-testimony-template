# Child-Centered Principles

Focus on outcomes that benefit the child:
- stability and routine
- predictable parenting time
- safe exchanges
- school continuity
- reduced conflict exposure
- respectful communication

When writing, ask:
- “How does this affect the child’s day-to-day?”
- “What solution reduces future conflict?”
- “What can be verified?”
