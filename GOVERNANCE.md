# Governance (Template Maintenance)

## Maintainers
Maintainers should:
- keep the template neutral and non-jurisdiction-specific
- avoid “tactics” that instruct people how to manipulate the court
- prioritize privacy, safety, and child well-being

## Contributions
- Add clarity, checklists, and neutral language examples
- Improve privacy guidance and provenance structure
- Avoid adding state-specific legal claims unless cited and generalized
